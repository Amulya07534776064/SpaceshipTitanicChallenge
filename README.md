**1 ##🚀 Spaceship Titanic – A Kaggle Adventure**
  This is our take on the [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) Kaggle competition — a fun, sci-fi-themed machine learning challenge.
  **The mission?**
  Predict which passengers got mysteriously "transported" to another dimension after a cosmic accident. 


**2 ##🌌 What's This Project About?**

 In this project, We explored the dataset, clean and transform the data, engineer useful features, and build predictive models using tools "XGBoost" and "LIGHTGBM".

 You'll find code for:

 > 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 > 🧹 Data cleaning & missing value handling
 > 🏗️ Feature engineering (like decoding cabin info & calculating total spending)
 > 🤖 Model training & evaluation
 > 📁 Generating a Kaggle submission


**3 ## 📁 Files Included**

Here's what you'll find in this repo:

**4 ##🛠️ What we Did:**
   Here’s a quick rundown of what’s going on inside the notebook:

   **Exploration:** Visualized distributions, correlations, and checked out who was more likely to be transported.
  
   **Cleaning:** Filled in missing values for age, spending, and categorical fields using smart heuristics.

   **Feature Engineering:**
    > Broke down the Cabin into deck, number, and side.
    > Created a TotalExpenses which includes Room Service, Food Court, Shopping Mall, Spa and VRDeck.

   **Modeling:**
    > Tried several classifiers, tuned hyperparameters, and validated with cross-validation.
    > Submitted predictions to Kaggle for scoring.

**5 ##🛠️  Main Components:**
    > notebooks/: Google Colab for EDA and model development.
    > src/: Scripts for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.
    > submission/: Final .csv files for Kaggle submission.
    > models/: Saved models for reuse or deployment.
